# About Me

* 3rd year PhD student at the University of Sydney.
* Lectures and tutors first year Statistics (also involves teaching R!)
* My research revolves around developing statistical machine learning methods for high dimensional data.

* My undergrad is a BSc (Adv) degree, in which I majored in Mathematics and Statistics and graduated Hons I (Mathematical Statistics). It was in my first year of uni that I was introduced to R!

# Throwback - 2012

My journey with **R** began back in 2012 (nearly 6 years ago!) in first year stats. **R** was introduced as a glorified calculator.

# A typical first year question

$$\text{Suppose } X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1). \text{What is } P(X \leq 0.8)? $$

```{r cars, fig.height=3, dev='svg', eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
curve(dnorm(x), xlim = c(-2, 2), ylab = "", axes = FALSE)
abline(h = 0)
sequence = seq(-2, 0.8, 0.1)
polygon(x = c(sequence, 0.8, -2), y = c(dnorm(c(sequence)), 0, 0), col = "purple")
axis(1, at = c(-2, -1, 0, 0.8, 1, 2), pos = 0)
```

Answer:

```{r,  eval=TRUE}
pnorm(0.8)
```

# What I was formally taught during my undergraduate degree in R (2012 - 2015)

`r icon::fa("check", size=2)` Statistical modelling techniques

`r icon::fa("check", size=2)` ... and through that, baseR (by experience).

`r icon::fa("check", size=2)` Basic report making via Sweave implementation

***

**Essentially - a strong focus on Statistics, and less focus on Data Science! R was a means to the end.**


---

# What I was NOT formally taught during my undergraduate degree

`r icon::fa("times", size=2)` tidyverse, eg. `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `purrr`  packages

`r icon::fa("times", size=2)` rmarkdown/ xaringan slides/ blogdown

`r icon::fa("times", size=2)` advanced R topics such as functions, object orientated programming, good programming practice

`r icon::fa("times", size=2)` package development 

`r icon::fa("times", size=2)` git/ github/ version control

***

**I have had to learn (and not yet master) a lot of these things on my own accord during my PhD.**

# So, why am I telling you all of this?

class: center

## 1) Everyone still has something to learn in R, even if we have been using it for a long time

Especially those of us who learnt R 'formally'! For example, a lot of us are learning the `tidyverse` along side you! If you ask us for how to do things, we might give you a long baseR solution...

## 2) Learning these things takes time and patience, and life does get in the way!

# My tips on learning R

* My best improvements in R came from having clear motivations for WHY I was learning new skills
  + I learned `ggplot2` to make better data vis for presentations/publications/ packages
  + I learned how to develop packages to complement my research and to also improve workflow
  + I learned `xaringan` to make these slides today!
  + I am *slowly* learning `dplyr` to speed up my data vis steps! (Still hasn't made a way to my modelling yet though... not sure it ever will)

* Learn from examples! Eg, this presentation was based off Apres Hills R Ladies talk about blogdown! Work smart, not hard.

* Having a mentor is extremely useful. I found my coding to improve drastically after my honours year as I had great guidance from an expert (my supervisor).
